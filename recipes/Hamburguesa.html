        <p>Tailor Made Burgers</p>
        <p>about 10 large or 20 mini hamburgers come out, like the ones I made</p>
        <ul>
           <li>
            1kg minced meat
           </li> 
           <li>
            1 raw chorizo (criollo chorizo, if you are in Spain, or another that seems to you)
           </li>   
           <li>
            2 green onions (or 1 common onion)
           </li>
           <li>
            2 eggs (optional)
           </li>
           <li>
            2 cloves of garlic
           </li>
           <li>
            1 tsp paprika
           </li>
           <li>
            1 tbsp. chopped parsley
           </li>
           <li>
            Salt (about 2 tsp) and pepper
           </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
           <li>
            It's very easy! The first thing is to mix the minced meat well with the chorizo, remove the inside of the chorizo ​​and discard the skin.
           </li>
           <li>
            Once this is done, add the finely chopped onions and garlic, salt, pepper, paprika and parsley, also chopped.
           </li>
           <li>
            Once this is integrated, add the two eggs and mix well with your hands. You can add breadcrumbs to it (half a cup, no more). But these proportions work very well for me and the meat is just the way I want it. The egg is optional. Hamburgers are usually egg-free. I like how it is.
           </li>
           <li>
            Make homemade burgers. They can be made with mold. I like them made by hand, so that you can see that they are homemade. This time I made mini burgers.
           </li>
           <li>
            To cook: do I have to explain to you how to make a homemade hamburger? Yes? Good: heat a griddle or frying pan (very hot), put the hamburger and when it is on one side, turn it over (turn it over once). Until it's from the other. I accompanied them this time with a yamani rice with vegetables. This is because the hamburger is very discredited and a "healthy" side dish forces us to rethink (and reassess) its place on the plate.
